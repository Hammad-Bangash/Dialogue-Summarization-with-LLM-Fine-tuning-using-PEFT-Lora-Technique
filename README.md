<h1>Dialogue Summarization with LLM Fine-tuning using PEFT (Lora) Technique</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This repository contains the code and resources for fine-tuning a Language Model (LLM) for dialogue summarization using the PEFT (Lora) technique. The project aims to improve dialogue summarization by leveraging pre-trained language models and fine-tuning them on dialogue summarization datasets.</p>

<h2>Key Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Fine-tuning a pre-trained language model for dialogue summarization.</li>
    <li>Implementation of PEFT (Lora) technique for enhanced performance.</li>
    <li>Dataset preprocessing scripts for dialogue summarization datasets.</li>
    <li>Evaluation metrics for assessing the performance of the fine-tuned model.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Python 3.x</li>
    <li>DialogueSum Dataset</li>
    <li>Transformers library</li>
</ul>

<h2>Other Use Case</h2>
<ol>
<li><h3>Customer Support Applications</h3></li>
<p>One prominent application of this fine-tuned model is in the realm of customer support. It empowers support teams to swiftly determine the topic of discussion between clients and agents. By analyzing dialogue exchanges, the model can identify underlying issues, allowing support teams to respond more effectively and enhance overall customer satisfaction.</p>

<li><h3>Meeting Summarization</h3></li>
<p>Streamline post-meeting activities by using the model to generate concise summaries of discussions, decisions, and action items.</p>

<li><h3>Content Moderation</h3></li> 
<p>Employ the model to analyze user-generated content, helping to identify and address potentially sensitive or inappropriate discussions.</p>

<li><h3>Market Research</h3></li> 
<p>Accelerate the analysis of customer feedback, reviews, and forum discussions to extract valuable insights and trends.</p>
  
<li><h3>Knowledge Base Generation</h3></li>
<p>Enhance internal knowledge repositories by automatically summarizing extensive documentation or training materials.
