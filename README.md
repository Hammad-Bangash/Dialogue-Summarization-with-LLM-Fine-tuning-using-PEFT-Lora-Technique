# Dialogue-Summarization-with-LLM-Fine-tuning-using-PEFT-Lora-Technique
This repository contains the code and resources for fine-tuning a Language Model (LLM) for dialogue summarization using the PEFT (Lora) technique. The project aims to improve dialogue summarization by leveraging pre-trained language models and fine-tuning them on dialogue summarization datasets.
